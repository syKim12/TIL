Transformer
- Binarizer: feature values greater than the threshold are binarized to 1.0
- StringIndexer: i.e. Belgium -> 2, France -> 1
- IndexToString: symmetrically to StringIndexer, maps a column of label indicies back to a column containing the origin labels
- VectorIndexer: index categorical features in datasets of vectors
- Normalizer: transforms a dataset of vector rows, normalizing each vector to have unit norm
