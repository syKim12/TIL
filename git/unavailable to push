making sure to pull before push
If it doesn't work, then use below code
git pull origin 브랜치명 --allow-unrelated-histories

This command is used to save two projects' histories.
Git refuses to merge unrelated histories, but this command allows to merge histories

Sometimes it's impossible to push because there are some histories on github.
So I should check out git bash and check in again

Also sometimes the problem is solved by removing origin
ex. git remote rm origin => git remote add origin
So basically, removing origin and adding it again can also help to solve the problem.


If it's unavaliable to push because of confilcts, the best way is fixing the problem (rename or delete)
Rename or delete files and pull and push again
